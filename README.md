# BlockChain-Integration-with-SuppluChain-Management


The project aims to identify how to fit the two puzzles of Blockchain and Supply Chain together. There are existing systems in the market, but it still has various looholes. I have worked on this project soleley, and has been huge learning curve for me.

1. The first phase of the project was to understand block chain. It's coding required and how I can leverage smartcontracts and open ethereum pltforms to run my project. 
2. The base engineering design was as follows: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93303431/139183417-f1f17926-6387-427c-927f-b79bc9c6e53a.png)
3. The Second step was to understand the structure and flow of SupplyChain on a global level, and took the example of Fish Industry. 
4. I had the opportunity to discuss and learn from Professor Dr. Boris, from Copenhagen University. He has worked with the internaltional logistics company MAERSK. 
5. He gave his insights about the points where the issues were arising, and the steps taken by the team to cover come those challenges. 
6. Using Node-js (JAVA script Runtime enviornment) as my platform, and solidity as a compiler, I connected ot with Ganache ( Ethereum platform). 
7. Ganache formed the testing enviornment for my blcokchain, where I could track the creation, updation and transfer of smartcontracts.
8. Each smartcontract contains the detail for every product (fish in this example), and it's conditions and sellers were tracked using it.
